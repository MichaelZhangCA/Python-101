    "Given n ropes of different lengths, we need to connect these ropes into one rope. We can connect only k ropes at a time. The cost required to connect k ropes is equal to sum of their lengths. The length of this connected rope is also equal to the sum of their lengths. This process is repeated until n ropes are connected into a single rope. Find the min possible cost required to connect all ropes.\n",
